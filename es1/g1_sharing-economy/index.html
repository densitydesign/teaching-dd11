Even if sharing economy is considered as a revolution, activities such as collaboration, swapping, renting and lending aren’t new, but are old as the library. People have always cooperated to share resources, work and relationships. In recent years these kind of customs are becoming an economic model thanks to some elements that have driven the “sharing” from an unstructured and informal phenomenon to an organized one. Three market forces have contributed to the rise of “sharing economy”.

                    <P>When a company is acquired from another company, two different trends regarding the buyer come up to our analysis: older “non sharing economy” companies that open up to this new model, or “sharing” companies that acquire others sharing “companies” in order to expand. </p>

            <div class="row">
                <p class="col-sm-6">In the dataset there were four elements for each company to compare and analyze: total amount of funding, number of rounds, number of investors and the age. The comparison between the four mentioned elements was facilitated by the creation of indicators such as the average of rounds per year and the average of funding per investor. The cluster of the data through these indicators didn’t point out meaningful groups but underlined the presence of a common behaviour of most part of the companies, in opposition to a few outsiders with a very different behaviour.
                </p>
                <p class="col-sm-6"> That’s why a weight function was used to normalize the data in order to find similar patterns between the behaviours of the companies, but the outcome of the analysis is a group of homogeneous clusters with similar properties. The final and definitive approach that led us to our visualization was driven by a change of the point of view: the exceptions, such as Uber, Airbnb and Lyft, bring us to a more interesting analysis compared to a focus on the big homogeneous group of the remaining companies.</p>

                <p class="col-sm-5">From the cluster analysis we can easily see that there are a few companies out of the mass: their investments, longevity, numbers of investors and rounds are usually higher than the remaining companies. There are companies with a long life and a high number of investments, like Prosper. Homeaway, is the example of how a company can be long life lasting even without big investments, thanks to the collaborative behaviours of its users. Some, such as the new Uber and Lyft, are pretty young but they can attire a high number of investment.

                    <P>Even if Italy doesn’t have a big impact on the international scenario, the Italian market of sharing companies is pretty fresh and growing. In this section, data visualizations are based on the dataset provided by Marta Mainieri, founder of Collaboriamo, an Italian organization that provides consultancy for collaborative platforms. The dataset is composed only by Italian companies or international companies that operate in Italy. It has been taken in consideration only the peer-to-peer model (for example, companies such as Car2go or Enjoy have not been taken in consideration because their assets belong to the company). The dataset has been integrated with the Italian crowdfunding platforms annual report released by Daniela Castrataro and Ivana Pais from the Italian crowdfunding network.

The bar chart on the right illustrates the amount of companies for each industry: money, goods and services are the most relevant. On the left there is a comparison between the country of birth and where they operate. Most of the companies are Italian and operate in Italy.</p>

                        2011 is the key-year for sharing economy in Italy: we go from 68 to 103 new companies in just one year, covering most of the industries. The boost starts slowing down in 2013, where we can see that companies in the financial area are the most prolific and interesting for this new economy.

                    <P>In conclusion, we assist to a continuous expansion of this new economy, which began in the US and was gradually adopted by the other countries of the world. Due to this new and evolving trend, games are still on and the current state and possible future of cooperation is still not that clear. It would be interesting to compare companies not only by founding but also by the sales, to check if the sharing economy is that effective and successful. The question is: </p>
                    <p><u>Is it only the network that gives value to people or these giants companies are successful just because there is a vertical organized structure in addition to the network of people?</u></p>
